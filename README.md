# ATR-FAS: Flash Light Anti-Spoofing
This is an unofficial implementation of the paper [Enhancing Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing: A Robust Framework for Diverse Attack Types under Screen Flash](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15346). There are modifications based on the original [code](https://github.com/Chaochao-Lin/ATR-FAS). Instead of using 2D convolution, we use 3D convolution to extract more features from the sequence of frames. The architecture is as follows:

The code is a work in progress.
